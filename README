= Simple Web Shop

Created by: Patrick Aebischer (patrick.aebischer AT maqsis DOT ch), January 2009

This extension allows you to create a simple tiny web shop. It's basically
a form where where you can choose the products / quantity you are interested
in and enter the delivery address. There is no payment or anything involved.

It might be useful for small companies selling just some (let's say up to
5 or 10) products and want to have a more or less intelligent form where
clients could post an order. The order is then send as an email to the
shop owner.

Via the admin interface you can add new products, change prices or view
placed orders. 


== Usage

The products are managed via the admin interface where you can add new
products, change prices and view placed orders.

There are no config options via the admin interface nor are there any
radiant tags involved. If you want to change the layout or anything
you need to touch the files from the extension.


== Integration into Radiant

The shop uses the url /shop. To render the correct layout you need to
create this page in the admin interface. You must the include the
tag <shoptag> where the shop elements should be placed. 

The second page you need to create is /danke. After an order has been
placed this redirect will take place.


== Limitations

This extension is not very customizable via Radiant. All has to be
done in the code of the extension.
